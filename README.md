# copulastatistic
All code related to the paper: "A Copula Statistic for Measuring Nonlinear Multivariate Dependence"

# copulastatistic.R
Provides code to compute the CoS statistic for 2-D,3-D, and 4-D data currently.  We will generalize this into one function that can detect the dimensionality and automatically process that data.

# algorithms.R
Other dependence metric algorithms used to compare against the CoS
Note: please use the minerva-r package here: https://github.com/stochasticresearch/minerva-r in order to compute the MICe rather than the stock minerva package from CRAN, which computes the MIC.

# codefigX.R
The code required to plot Figure<X> in the paper. 

# tableX.R
The code required to generate results for Table <X> in the paper.

# financialData.R
The code required to generate results relaed to the Financial data in the paper.

# yeast.R
The code required to generate the results for Fig.14 in the paper.

# ecoli.R
The code required to generate the results for Fig.16 in the paper.
